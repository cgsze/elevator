# Elevator
This program simulates an elevator being used through a live feedback loop to visit the floors requested by the user. 

Future Updates to be Added:
- Timings for how long to wait for elevator
- Pushing multiple button requests at once
- Deciding whether to move up or down based on current floor and requests
- Choosing when to open and close elevator doors
- restricted access to certain floors
- multiple elevators deciding which requests to respond to
