# Elevator
This program simulates an elevator being used through a live feedback loop to visit the floors requested by the user. 

Potential Updates to be Added:
- Timings for how long to wait for elevator
- Pushing multiple button requests at once
- Deciding whether to move up or down based on current floor and requests
